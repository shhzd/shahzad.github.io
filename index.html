<h2>Some info about me :</h2>
<article>
    <p>I've had multiple jobs throughout the years, all of them very diverse. I first started as a wholesale jeweler, selling Asian jewelry and antiques.<br>
    Then I worked in retail in a library for some time, I also delved in the horeca sector for a bit, making Japanese food. 
    <br> In parallel during downtimes I have also been working as a tutor for the longest, teaching maths and languages.
    <br> My passion has always been computer science though, I love building PC's, and I am currently in my second year of studies towards a bachelor's degree in that field. </p>
    <p>I love learning about a wide array of subjects, such as astronomy, history, religions, computer science, etc. I also love learning new languages : <br>
    These days I am strenthening my German at times, and also learning a bit of Arabic. </p>
    <p>During my free time I am usually watching a show, youtube, or playing videogames. I especially love games that require good team communication.
        <br> I'd also love to go to the gym more often but it's been harder since the lockdown.</p>
