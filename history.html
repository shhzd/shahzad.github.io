    <div class="sea"><h2>The Sea Peoples</h2>
        <p>Around 1210 BCE appeared a nation of seafarers seemingly out of nowhere, there are many theories about their origin but they remain unidentified.
            <br>They attacked Egypt and other regions around the East Mediterranean such as Cyprus, Syria, Anatolia. The discovery of the reports about them around the 19th
            <br>is one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history.
            <br>The Egyptians have written about them on many steles and reliefs, starting with Ramesses II. 
            <br>Some strange detail about this piece of history is that we know that the nations around the Mediterranean knew each other very well, 
            <br>and they could identify other peoples through their clothes and weapons. But even reporters at that period in time had no idea about the identity 
            <br>of those invaders. Drawings on many walls show their particular pieces of armor, and their style remains unidentified until today. 
            <br>Another detail is that it seems like those Sea Peoples disappeared as abruptly as they first appeared, and no traces of them can be found 
            <br>except for the aformentioned inscriptions and reports.
            <br>
            <br>This subject is dear to me because it shows how little we actually know of history, and how much has been lost. How many books and encyclopedias 
            <br>could be filled with all this lost information, perhaps never to be recovered again, it boggles the mind.
